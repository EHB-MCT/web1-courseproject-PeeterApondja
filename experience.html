        <h2>Delhaize Warehouse Ninove</h2>
        <h3>Team coordinator logistics and process management</h3>

          In the Delhaize warehouse I was responsible for efficiently packing and
          organizing pallets. Thanks to my experience I acted as a go‑to person
          for new colleagues and helped streamline processes so daily goals were
          consistently met.
